## 📖 Background

This was my second project in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive, completed during Week 6 of the 12-week course. It took me five days to write.

It demonstrates everything we'd learnt so far about Ruby on Rails.

## 🎯 Project Brief

The brief was simply to create any kind of web application that demonstrated our understanding of CRUD databases.

See the full spec here: [Project-Brief.md](Project-Brief.md).


## 🛠 Web Scraping

Gems used:

* `httparty`
* `nokogiri`

To get actual data from:
